This is a prototype of an Authentication/Authorization service, implemented
in Ruby on Rails.  It does nothing useful.  It contains no code you would
want to copy or study, as I'm a total noob to Ruby/Rails.

The service methods are in lib/auth_service.rb
The methods are exposed via JSON-RPC, using http://agilewebdevelopment.com/plugins/json_rpc
